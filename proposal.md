Classmates' Feedback: Overall, our peer reviewers said that we should move away from ideas that deal with the UCSD campus being mapped out since such ideas have already been implemented. Although one of our reviewers said that they do not fully understand the concept of our travel tracking idea yet, we felt that this idea is unique and will be understandable to the user as we add cool and easy-to-use features.

Proposed Features: 

We plan to develope our app as a desktop web app and implement a full screen map in order to take advantage of the larger monitor size as compared to a mobile app. Travel Tracker will parse through users email and photos in order to topographically display information to the user on where they've traveled to, length of their stay, and up coming travel destinations. The user will also be able to toggle the screen to see different visualizations of the data. A heat map will be displayed over the map demonstrating routes taken while clusters will represent length of time in a destination or number of visits. The user will also be able to add new data to their visualizations. 

Splitting the Work: Teammate #1 will work on the front-end views and interactions. They will also come up with designs for visualizations of the data sets we work with. Teammate #2 will work on the server-side. They will set up React or Node and the database we use. They will also create all the apis needed to access the information in order to display. Teammate #3 and Teammate #4 will work on the map functionality setup as well as data visualization libraries, such as D3. They will incorpate each of the libraries nessaray for our gapplication and join the data to it.
