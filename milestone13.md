Ameer Muhtaseb: Worked on making nicer legends for some of the visualizations, cleaned up some older code and helped test

Khaled Ahmad: I worked on connecting the Facebook API login and getting the data from the facebook API. Currently the heatmap's data is fully connected to the API and draws live data from the API. I also created the login page, and the login flow. 


This is a new visualization that we added. It's a bar graph that allows users to see how much they traveled in a given 
month, where they traveled in that month, and how much time they spent in that specific place. The different places traveled
to in the same month are differentiated by different colored blocks within the same bar.
