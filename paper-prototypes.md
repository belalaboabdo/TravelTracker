This prototype shows the global scale feature where users can view the entire globe and where they have traveled. A spot on the globe with photos shows the user where they have traveled to. The user can zoom in/out for different views and drag the globe to make it spin. The map also shows the order in which the user has traveled to these places. Additionally, if the user clicks on the on the photos then they will be able to look through them and see past memories.
