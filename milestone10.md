1. What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.

We are creating a quick and easy way for people to keep track of where they have visited/traveled and be able to share
their trips with friends.

2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?

Today, people use Facebook or Snapchat to post pictures/statuses/stories which eventually get lost with time. These forms of 
sharing trips are not organized in one complete medium (ex numerous facebook statuses that cannot be linked to each other).

3. What’s new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?

In our approach it is much easier to collect and track data from numerous trips in a cohesive format so that users can see 
when and where they traveled all in one easy to use platform.

4. Who cares? If you’re successful, what difference will it make?

In today's society, sharing where you visit is a very popular activity so this will attract people who love to travel,
try different types of food, and people who often use social media in general. If successful, this could potentially become the
main form of keeping track of trips on social media, or maybe become a popular core feature of sharing location on Facebook.
