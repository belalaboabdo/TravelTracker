Description of what each team member has done:
  
  Khaled Ahmad: Edited paramerters for Google Maps API to fit in the screen and have a larger radius for the heat map locations. Also researched NodeJS so that we can use it for our application. 
  
  Belal Aboabdo: Hard coded longitude and latidude data for heatmap, researched setup for Vega and leaflet API's. 
  
  Shreeman Hariharan: Researched how to use the Google Maps API and include the heatmap layering over the map.
  
  Ameer Muhtaseb: Hard coded somem longitude/latitude points for the heat map, created the milestone 5 markdown file and

Description:
  This screenshot shows a heat map of where a user has visited/traveled to. Just like any other heat map, the bigger/more red
  a point on the map is, the more places the user has been to in that particular area. The heat map is just one of the several
  different views that we plan on implementing for our app.
